Manifest version 2 is deprecated in Chrome, and support will be removed in 2023. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/ for more details.
    will have to look into what changes will need to be made
        I made a manifestV3 already, does not appear that FireFox supports it yet.
            I still need to check that everything works in chrome with it, as I don't remember
            just rename||delete??? opposing file before uploading?

Make a new icon to link to options while on entitlements page
    Clipboard icon with a gear on it?
    Link to FireFox options https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Options_pages
    Link to Chrome options https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#method-openOptionsPage

Add some type of progress indicator or still working type of symbol
    It can take some time to scrape and filter / api call and filter
        some type of in progress notification would be nice to have

Add options for API call
    delivery_methods
    genres
    THEY ARE ONLY AVAILABLE ON CHOICE/MONTHLIES ???
        add key_type_human_name as an option? or in combination with delivery_methods???
        combine delivery_methods && genres into the addlChoice option???

Remove txt file saving option when API call is active (since the text file is still in JSON format....)

I've had two reports of the scraper not working when fetching monthlies
    API call option worked for both people while scraper had the issue
        the scraper's url = "https://www.humblebundle.com/membership/september-2021"
            or whatever is in the href of the choice button elements 
        the api call's url = `https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/${choice_url}`
    Error from both was
        Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'innerText')
        at fetchMonthlies (hbKeyPgNameScraper.js:76:90)
        fetchMonthlies @ hbKeyPgNameScraper.js:76
    I have a patch in place to get past the Error / continue past problem bundles
        it should now console.log() whichever bundles don't have: 
            id of "webpack-monthly-product-data" 
            || are missing .innerText 
            || are missing contentChoiceOptions inside of .innerText 
    v0.77 has a hotfix in place, it was catching up on games that gave the choice between key redemptions
        I need to make it save those game names even when fetch monthlies is not enabled in the options

    It seems HumbleBundle has changed the provided data for monthly choice bundles from the API call
        If they don't change it back to include all the data, like unredeemed keys
            I may be able to fetch the bundles web page and then add the data wanted from there
                tartget them by looking if it has "choice_url" ???
