RELEASE NOTES v0.74

This release brings an entirely different way to gather information of all your purchases!
The API call found in options can retrieve much more info than the scraper.
I've added new options/filters to go with the new way :)

Please be careful where you save the file, it can now contain your product keys!

You will probably notice that enabling/disabling some options will hide other options.
I did this so that only relevant options are shown at the time.  Hopefully it makes it feel more user friendly?

When using the new API call option to retrieve more data, it doesn't get much info on your choice bundles.
I am considering adding some scraping to go along with the API call for the choices so that they have some more relevant information.

You can now join me on Discord if you have suggestions / comments or just wanna talk about the extension!
