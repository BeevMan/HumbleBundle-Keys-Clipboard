Added support for "choice less" monthlies
    sorry if the format has been like this for awhile, I just noticed/haven't subbed for some time
    please contact me if you notice any further issues with it

Some users reported that the scraper didn't work while fetching monthlies
    I put in a work around
        should now log the urls that were throwing errors previously
        then continue on with the rest as usual
    Please let me know via discord, gmail/contact email, or github if you notice any of these logged in your console
        or if you notice anything else that seems off or that could be improved!!!

Added a button that links to the extensions options
    pushed the update sooner than I would have liked, due to the previous two notes
        the styling is ugly on the button, I'm sorry.

Added two options for the API call
    delivery_methods
    genres
    they are only available on choice/monthlies from what i've seen.
        I may add key_type_human_name as an option in the future.  It's similar to delivery_methods but in previous bundles and or non choice?
        I will probably add delivery_methods && genres into the addlChoice option in the future.  Since they're only found in Choice.
