RELEASE NOTES v0.75  
  
When doing a filtered API call scraping data from choices is now possible.  
  Check/enable "Extra Choice data" in options.  
  It will fetch the Choice data then filter and return  
    maxChoices: how many choices you purchased that month,  
    choicesUsed: amount of choices used for that month,  
    unMadeChoices: unchosen choice games  
  
Keys & Entitlements page scraper, now has options to insert characters before & after the gathered names.  
  This can be useful for adding formatting to your list without the need for an external editor.  

Refactored some code to hopefully make it easier to read for my future self or any contributors.
