Extra Choice data will no longer return bundle data when all choices are used/ there are no unredeemed titles in the bundle and 
redeemed keys options is unchecked.  
  
Extra Choice data wasn't returning the correct amount of starting choices in some monthlies that provided all choices.  
  - Should now be correct for all monthly choice bundles.
