#### How does it work?
The scraper (original way) works by going through each entry on your keys & entitlements pages.
While using the scraper you have the option to fetch your choices (monthlies) by retrieving each individual choice url.

The API call works by interacting with Humble Bundle's API.
It will retrieve every purchase on your account and then filter if chosen to do so in options.
Much more information can be retrieved from the API call!


#### Where and why did this start?
This repository is a continuation of the script that I originally started in my [steam-game-linker](https://github.com/BeevMan/steam-game-linker) project.  
You may find use of that project if trying to match a different list of games to Steam as well.  
I hope to have this extension fully replace the goal of that project (matching my list from Humble to Steam).  
This extension is still being worked on and growing in functionality.  
Unlike the [original script v0.725](https://github.com/BeevMan/steam-game-linker/blob/master/scripts/hbKeyPgNameLister.js), this will not work in your browsers console.
