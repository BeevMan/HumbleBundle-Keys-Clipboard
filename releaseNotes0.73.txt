Fetching August monthly choices broke the extension.
  This is now fixed, HumbleBundle changed the subscription variables naming.
  I can not guarantee this is working for all choice subscription as I only have the classic plan.  
  I am hopefull I have implemented a solution for all choice subscriptions. 

Options are now implemented!
  I will be adding to these options in the future.
  
"clipboardWrite" is now an optional permission.
  If changing your saving option to clipboard you will be prompted to allow the permission.
  Once the permission is accepted, you should not be prompted of it again.
  The permission will turn off when switching your saving option to anything other then clipboard.
